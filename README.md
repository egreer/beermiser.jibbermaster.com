*A price and alcohol content calculator for the budget conscious drinker.*

When at your favorite beer garden with lots of options and sizes enter your favorites into the calculator to price out the best bang for your dollar. Pricing will calculate using Alcohol by Volume (`ABV`) or Alcohol by Weight (`ABW`) and sizing in Ounces (`oz`), Milliliter (`mL`) and Liter (`L`) and converts it to a standard alcohol and calculates the Price per Ounce (`$/oz`) and Price per Alcohol (`$/A`) for easy comparison.
